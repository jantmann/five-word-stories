Welcome to amyMani Story Page
Today is a beautiful day
Sarah is visiting New York today
with her boyfriend Joey Tribbiani
They have a bucket list
The first on the list is
to visit One World Observatory
which is in downtown Manhattan
They had nine other things 
Seeing Cherry Blossom is the 2nd 
However, they have only 5 hours
They are hungry as well
They decide to eat first
Sarah heard that Seafood in
Johnny's Reef in Long Island
has the best fried scallops
So they took a detour
there to enjoy some food
and sea breeze. That was
all for their NY tour!
