Once there was a girl, she lived near a lake, she was sleepy and hungry, so she went to hike,
although this doesn't make sense, she was an unordinary person, she befriended two nice frogs, and they did everything
together, they even played pickleball together, near the lake they sang, a song about strawberry pancakes, to all of
the creatures, they joined together and frolicked, around the flowers and mushrooms, they ate many strange mushrooms, and
had some wild dreams, one where they were flying,
