Hi Sophie this is the first commit.
Hi Zixu this is the second commit.
Once upon a time, there was a small dog who wants to get a yummy breakfast.
He decided to walk to a bakery that sells delicious baked goods.
When he got there, he ate them.
Yum Yum Yum Yum Yum.
He loves that bakery so much that he went back and ordered 56 blueberry muffins
The next day he wanted even more muffins, so he ordered 100 pumpkin muffins.
Then, prove that (56+100)^e^-ln(1/256) = chocolate muffin
And, simplify your answer completely.
Can you solve it Jake?
Submit when you are done.
