Today is a sunny Tuesday
But looking forward to tomorrow. 
A squirrel stole my sandwich.
Right from my picnic blanket. 
"Oh no! What should I
do! ... throw a rock at it!"
I chased it around the
park, up a tree, and 
accidentally tripped over a log
then fell into fresh manure.
I stood up, brushing off 
everything, giving up on the
revenge against squirrel. I decided
to go home and sleep. 
In my dream, I realized
That the squirrel was taunting 
and I didn't shower before
so really the whole day 
was a nightmare. Luckily, I
had another sandwich for tomorrow.
