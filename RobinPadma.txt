It was a dark and rainy summer evening. Jane is reading a book, unaware of 
the upcoming dangerous event that would scar her for eternity. A human 
figure rose from the storm, holding a white apron with MasterChef logo. 
Gordon Ramsey screamed, "You idiot sandwhich!". Jane's heart raced with 
dread. She tried fighting back, "I'll prove you wrong, Chef!". Then, she 
whipped out his favorite, Beef Wellington, perfectly medium rare. Gordon, 
tearing up, destroyed the moment by shouting, "It's raw!". Jane, grabbing a 
frying pan, screamed, "Where's the lamb sauce?". It was too late though, 
so they went back home.
